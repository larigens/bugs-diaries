## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

Click `<> code` - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows/Linux, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally. If you need more information on how to clone a repository, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)!

### Prerequisites

This package requires you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), npm, Inquirer, [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) installed on your machine. You can install these by running the code below on your terminal:

For `npm`

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

For `Node.js`

```bash
npm i node@lts
```

For `Express.js`

```bash
npm i express
```

### Setting Up

Open the project in VS Code and make sure you are in the directory of this application before installing the dependencies. To install it, type the commands below on your terminal:

You can also open the project in VS Code, make sure you are in the directory of this application and then type the command below on your terminal:

Once you run this, npm will begin the installation process of all of the current project's dependencies.
